Original Method: 
(1) Preprocessing template image. 
(2) Cropping template from preprocessed canvas. 
(3) Creating a series of rotated cropped images. 

Troubleshooting: 
- Produces white boxes when rotating images. 


Current Method: 
(1) Create a series of rotated cropped images from canvas first. 
(2) Preprocess each rotated canvas image. 
(3) Extract cropped template from each preprocessed rotated image. 

Troubleshooting: 
- Since crop_template method isolates the coordinates from the template image without rewriting the image entirely, 
  the cropped images from the rotated canvases do not produce clean templates if there is noise in its vicinity. 
  -> May be resolved if clean template images are used (ie. single object on black background). 
- Small parts of white boxes may remain after producing cropped templates.
