Computing Angle of Rotation Considering Object Orientation
- Fix a midpoint at the top of the template image that is mapped onto the canvas image. 
- Three points are to be used to determine the object orientation and following angle calculation: 
  top_midpoint.y, center.y, pca_p1.y  
Four possible scenarios: 
(1) Template and first principal component oriented in opposite direction, template is upward facing/principal component downard facing.
    Angle: theta = theta - 90 

(2) Template and first principal component oriented in opposite direction, template is downward facing/principal component upward facing.
    Angle: theta = theta + 270 (initial theta negative) 

(3) Template and first principal component oriented in same direction, both upward facing. 
    Angle: theta = theta + 90 (intial theta negative) 

(4) Template and first principal component oriented in same direction, both downward facing.  
    Angle: theta = theta + 90
